Description: Weak-signal amateur radio communications
 WSJT-X implements amateur radio communication protocols or "modes" called
 FST4, FST4W, FT4, FT8, JT4, JT9, JT65, Q65, MSK144, and WSPR, as well as one
 called Echo for detecting and measuring your own radio signals reflected from
 the Moon. These modes were all designed for making reliable, confirmed QSOs
 under extreme weak-signal conditions.
 .
 JT4, JT9, and JT65 use nearly identical message structure and source encoding
 (the efficient compression of standard messages used for minimal QSOs). They
 use timed 60-second T/R sequences synchronized with UTC. JT4 and JT65 were
 designed for EME ("moonbounce") on the VHF/UHF/microwave bands. JT9 is
 optimized for the MF, and HF bands. It is about 2 dB more sensitive than
 JT65 while using less than 10% of the bandwidth. Q65 offers submodes with a
 wide range of T/R sequence lengths and tone spacings.
 .
 FT4 and FT8 are operationally similar but use T/R cycles only 7.5 and 15 s
 long, respectively. MSK144 is designed for Meteor Scatter on the VHF bands.
 These modes offer enhanced message formats with support for nonstandard
 callsigns and some popular contests.
 .
 FST4 and FST4W are designed particularly for the LF and MF bands. On these
 bands their fundamental sensitivities are better than other WSJT-X modes with
 the same sequence lengths, approaching the theoretical limits for their rates
 of information throughput. FST4 is optimized for two-way QSOs, while FST4W is
 for quasi-beacon transmissions of WSPR-style messages. FST4 and FST4W do not
 require the strict, independent time synchronization and phase locking of
 modes like EbNaut.
 .
 WSPR mode implements a protocol designed for probing potential propagation
 paths with low-power transmissions. WSPR is fully implemented within WSJT-X,
 including programmable "band-hopping".
